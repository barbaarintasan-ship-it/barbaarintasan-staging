Replit Agent – Implementation Instructions (ENGLISH)

Context
This app includes a Parent Community Feed (Facebook-like feed) where parents can post content. Because the app involves parents and children, strict legal compliance, moderation, and user consent are mandatory.

1. Mandatory Terms & Conditions Gate (Before Feed Access)

Requirement
Create a dedicated “Parent Community Terms & Conditions” page that users MUST read and accept before accessing the Parent Feed.

Behavior

When a parent clicks “Parent Feed” for the first time:

Redirect them to /parent-community-terms

Display full Community Guidelines + Child Safety Rules

The page must include:

A scrollable Terms & Conditions text

A required checkbox:
“I have read and agree to the Parent Community Terms & Conditions”

A disabled Continue button until the checkbox is checked

Enforcement

Save acceptance in the database (e.g. user.hasAcceptedCommunityTerms = true)

If not accepted:

Block all access to feed routes (read, post, comment)

If accepted:

Allow access to Parent Feed

Acceptance must persist across sessions and devices
